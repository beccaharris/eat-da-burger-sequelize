# Eat-Da-Burger
This app allows users to list and keep track of burgers they want to eat and have already eaten.<br>
Check it out on <a href="https://bharris-eat-da-burger.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>

## Getting Started 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
* Node
* Clone repo to your local computer. 

### Installing
```
npm init 
npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm install mysql
npm install method-override
npm install express-handlebars
```
*Ensure the ```node_modules/ ``` folder is in your .gitignore file. If it's not, add it.*

## Running it
* Open the app in your integrated terminal or cd into the app folder in your regular terminal
* Run ```node server.js```
* Navigate to localhost:8080
* You can type in a new burger in the main text field and click submit - it should appear in the list of burgers you want to eat. You can click the little bue button with a knife and fork to "check off" the burger, saying that you have eaten it. It will move to the list on the right.
